🌟 Overview


Dine Dash is a bespoke, web-based platform designed to modernize room service in the hospitality industry—focusing on small and mid-sized hotels, guesthouses, and boutique businesses.
Unlike leading brands with high-end systems, many small establishments rely on phone calls, handwritten notes, and limited menus, leading to errors and slow service. Dine Dash provides an affordable, modern, plug-and-play solution.
